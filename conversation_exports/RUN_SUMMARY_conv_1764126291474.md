## Progress Report: Advanced Communication Protocol Development

**Primary Goal:** Build a production-ready secure communication protocol with encryption, packet integrity verification, reliable delivery (ACK/NACK), and retry mechanisms.

**Progress Made:**
• Consolidated 49 code fragments into cohesive implementations with encryption, hash verification, and intrusion detection
• Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff and MAX_RETRIES limits to prevent infinite loops  
• Developed queue-based non-blocking packet handling with comprehensive error codes and logging

**Current Status:** 85% complete - Core protocol features implemented but consolidation process incomplete

**Next Steps:**
• Complete the final consolidated implementation file with all methods properly integrated
• Add comprehensive testing suite and usage examples for the complete protocol

**Blockers:** None - all major technical challenges resolved, just need to finish the consolidation process.
