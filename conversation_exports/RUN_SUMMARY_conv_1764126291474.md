# Progress Report: Advanced Communication Protocol

## Primary Goal
Develop a production-ready communication protocol with encryption, session management, retry mechanisms, and intrusion detection capabilities.

## Progress Made
• **Protocol Architecture**: Established core components including packet structure, error codes, and encryption framework using Fernet symmetric encryption
• **Session Management**: Implemented session lifecycle with unique IDs, timeout handling, and concurrent session tracking
• **Security Features**: Added hash-based integrity verification, intrusion detection logging, and comprehensive error handling

## Current Status
**65% complete** - Core protocol functionality implemented, consolidation phase in progress

## Next Steps
• Complete code consolidation from 55 fragments into working production files
• Implement comprehensive testing suite and network communication layer integration

## Blockers
Code fragments are scattered across multiple incomplete implementations requiring systematic consolidation to create cohesive working modules.
