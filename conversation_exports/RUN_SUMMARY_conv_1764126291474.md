**Progress Report - Advanced Communication Protocol**

**Primary Goal:** Build a production-ready secure communication protocol with encryption, hash verification, session management, and intrusion detection.

**Progress Made:**
• Developed core protocol components including packet encryption (Fernet), SHA-256 hash verification, and ACK/NACK reliability mechanisms
• Implemented session management with state tracking, retry logic with exponential backoff, and comprehensive error handling
• Created intrusion detection system with threat monitoring, rate limiting, and automatic response capabilities

**Current Status:** 85% complete - all major components designed but final integration incomplete

**Next Steps:**
• Complete the main protocol class integration and finalize queue-based packet handling
• Add comprehensive testing suite and production deployment configuration

**Blockers:** None - code consolidation was interrupted mid-implementation but all components are well-defined.
