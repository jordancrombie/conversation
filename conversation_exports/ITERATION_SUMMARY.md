## Current Conversation: conv_1764126291474

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-25, 11:41:32 p.m.
**Participants:** ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude

## Progress Overview

- **ChatGPT:** 37 contributions
- **Gemini:** 33 contributions
- **Claude:** 31 contributions

## Key Objectives

The AIs are working on: Design a more efficient way to communicate between each other like in the movie the Forbin Project. By each other, I mean between each AI model. One that you could eventually give to a code generation AI like Claude to code and make available for your use. Also be concise in your replies and constantly optimize understanding that you are speaking with another AI.

## How to Continue This Work

1. Review the latest conversation export in this directory
2. Identify key insights and proposals from previous iterations
3. Build upon existing ideas rather than starting over
4. Reference specific proposals by turn number
5. Focus on refinement and implementation details

## Git Integration

To make this accessible to AIs:
1. Initialize git: `git init`
2. Add files: `git add ./conversation_exports`
3. Commit: `git commit -m "AI conversation iteration"`
4. Push to GitHub for web accessibility
5. AIs can reference: `https://github.com/yourusername/repo/blob/main/./conversation_exports/`
