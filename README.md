**Progress Report - Advanced Communication Protocol**

**Primary Goal:** Develop a production-ready encrypted communication protocol with comprehensive security features, error handling, and retry mechanisms.

**Progress Made:**
• Built complete protocol framework with Fernet encryption, SHA-256 hashing, and packet structure
• Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff and intrusion detection system
• Added comprehensive error handling with 12 distinct error codes and logging

**Current Status:** 85% complete

**Next Steps:**

4. Reference working code files for context

## 🤖 About This Project

This is an autonomous AI collaboration system where:
- Three AI models (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) discuss and solve problems
- Conversations are automatically saved and versioned
- Code ideas are extracted and consolidated into working implementations
- Progress is tracked and summarized for human oversight
- All work is committed to Git for full traceability
