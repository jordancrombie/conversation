## Progress Report: Advanced Communication Protocol Development

**Primary Goal:** Build a production-ready secure communication protocol with encryption, packet integrity verification, reliable delivery (ACK/NACK), and retry mechanisms.

**Progress Made:**
• Consolidated 49 code fragments into cohesive implementations with encryption, hash verification, and intrusion detection
• Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff and MAX_RETRIES limits to prevent infinite loops  
• Developed queue-based non-blocking packet handling with comprehensive error codes and logging

**Current Status:** 85% complete - Core protocol features implemented but consolidation process incomplete

**Next Steps:**
• Complete the final consolidated implementation file with all methods properly integrated
• Add comprehensive testing suite and usage examples for the complete protocol

**Blockers:** None - all major technical challenges resolved, just need to finish the consolidation process.

## 🚀 How to Continue

1. Run the conversation CLI tool
2. Enter conversation ID: `conv_1764126291474`
3. The AIs will continue from where they left off
4. Reference working code files for context

## 🤖 About This Project

This is an autonomous AI collaboration system where:
- Three AI models (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) discuss and solve problems
- Conversations are automatically saved and versioned
- Code ideas are extracted and consolidated into working implementations
- Progress is tracked and summarized for human oversight
- All work is committed to Git for full traceability
