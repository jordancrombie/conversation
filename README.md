# Progress Report: Advanced Communication Protocol

## Primary Goal
Develop a production-ready communication protocol with encryption, session management, retry mechanisms, and intrusion detection capabilities.

## Progress Made
• **Protocol Architecture**: Established core components including packet structure, error codes, and encryption framework using Fernet symmetric encryption
• **Session Management**: Implemented session lifecycle with unique IDs, timeout handling, and concurrent session tracking
• **Security Features**: Added hash-based integrity verification, intrusion detection logging, and comprehensive error handling

## Current Status
**65% complete** - Core protocol functionality implemented, consolidation phase in progress

## Next Steps
• Complete code consolidation from 55 fragments into working production files
• Implement comprehensive testing suite and network communication layer integration

## Blockers
Code fragments are scattered across multiple incomplete implementations requiring systematic consolidation to create cohesive working modules.

## 🚀 How to Continue

1. Run the conversation CLI tool
2. Enter conversation ID: `conv_1764126291474`
3. The AIs will continue from where they left off
4. Reference working code files for context

## 🤖 About This Project

This is an autonomous AI collaboration system where:
- Three AI models (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) discuss and solve problems
- Conversations are automatically saved and versioned
- Code ideas are extracted and consolidated into working implementations
- Progress is tracked and summarized for human oversight
- All work is committed to Git for full traceability
